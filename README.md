# Big-Data-Analytics
This repository contains all my Jupyter Notebook files for my Big Data Analytics course. It includes practice exercises, case studies, and topic explorations covering key concepts in data analytics, storage, and processing. Note: All files includes were not submitted for grading, they are simply practice provided to us to strengthen our skills - including those names "Assignments", these are practice assignments that were optional

**Topics Covered:**

âœ” NumPy & Pandas â€“ Data manipulation and analysis

âœ” Matplotlib â€“ Data visualization techniques

âŒ› Big Data Storage Concepts â€“ Understanding storage systems

âŒ› Machine Learning â€“ Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning

âŒ› Classification & Clustering â€“ Deep learning and overfitting solutions

âŒ› Data Series Prediction â€“ Forecasting trends

âŒ› Data Processing â€“ Streaming vs. batch processing

âŒ› Apache Kafka & Spark â€“ Scalable data analytics


This repository will be continuously updated as I progress through the course. ðŸš€
